# 🌍 Earthquake Data Dashboard with Folium

## 📌 Project Overview
This project retrieves global earthquake data from the USGS API, processes and cleans it, visualizes it using Folium, and provides insights into earthquake frequency and magnitude over time and across geographical regions. Additionally, the DBSCAN algorithm is applied to classify earthquakes into clusters for further analysis.

## 🔍 Features
- Dynamic magnitude-based color map (yellow → red).
- Interactive maps to visualize earthquakes and the clusters generated by the DBSCAN model.
- Summary statistics.
- Modular, reusable Python scripts.

## 🛠️ How to Run
```bash
python visualize_earthquakes.py ''' If you want to visualize the data, two subplots will be generated
                                    along with a Folium map in HTML.'''

python earthquakes_DBSCAN.py '''Generates clustered_earthquakes_map.html and non_noise_clustered_earthquakes_map.html files.'''
python analysis.py  '''If you want to check the insights and summary of the data. '''
```
